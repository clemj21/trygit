This is MY SECOND GIT FILE.

Wonder how Untracked vs tracked vs modififed blah blah blah work

This modification will then cause a Staged/Modified/Untracked files with git status

making a change

how does diff work when same file is modified and in staged

Commit this and push it to the remote repository

what does this looklike in github gui
